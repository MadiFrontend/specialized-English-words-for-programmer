# Specialized English words for programmers
I have compiled a repository with the most frequently used words in programming and computer tutorials, which will certainly be helpful to you.
here's a list of them ...

- implement: (execute, apply) put (a decision, plan, agreement, etc.) into effect. | اجرا کردن و انجام دادن
- validate: check or prove the validity or accuracy of. |  معتبر ساختن
- determine: to find out or come to a decision about by investigation, reasoning, or calculation.. | تعیین کردن
- modify: to change something slightly. | تغییر جزئی، بهبود
- accurate: exact and true. | دقیق صحیح
- array: array programming refers to solutions that allow the application of operations to an entire set of values at once | آرایه
- Object: an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method. As regions of memory, objects contain a value and are referenced by identifiers | آبجکت

- OOP: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming style characterized by identifying classes of objects closely linked with the associated methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods. It is a technique based on a mathematical discipline, called “abstract data types,” for storing data with the procedures needed to process that data. OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of abstraction.

- FP: Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions.

- Algorithm: An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations. According to its formal definition, an algorithm is a finite set of instructions carried out in a specific order to perform a particular task. | الگوریتم

- Flowchart: A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process, system, or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve, and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. | فلوچارت

- Data structure: In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data | ساختمان داده

- Wireframe: a skeletal three-dimensional model in which only lines and vertices are represented.
an image or set of images which displays the functional elements of a website or page, typically used for planning a site's structure and functionality. | وایرفریم

- Framework: A framework, or software framework, is a platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications. Think of it as a template of a working program that can be selectively modified by adding code. | فریمورک، چارچوب

- Prototype: A prototype in software development is a simulation of how a real product will work and feel. It's used for design feedback and user testing. Purposefully broad in definition, they can come in all levels of sophistication– from an idea sketched on the back of a napkin to a clickable prototype that mimics real software. | نمونه اولیه


- Open source: Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. | متن باز، اوپن سورس
