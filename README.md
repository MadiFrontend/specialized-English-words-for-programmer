- OOP : Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods. It is a technique based on a mathematical discipline, called “abstract data types,” for storing data with the procedures needed to process that data. OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of abstraction.
